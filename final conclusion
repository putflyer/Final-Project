In conclusion, between all three metrics, Shadyside and Squirrel Hill South came really close. Shadyside, Squirrel Hill, and South Oakland all 
had very high fast food density and diversity making them the front runners from that category. Shadyside and Squirel Hill both weren't of any
significance in the traffic survey being squarely middle of the pack. The neighborhood that did win in the traffic survey wasn't even close in
any of the other metrics mostly because of just a lack of activity in that area. In the housing metric Shadyside and Squirel Hill both were way 
ahead of the pack with Shadyside being slightly ahead. Ultimatly it's this tiny amount more that makes Shadyside our best neighborhood for an
uber eats or doordash delivery driver who is only using a bycicle.
